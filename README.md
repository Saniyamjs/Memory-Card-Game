Tech Stack  HTML – Structure  CSS – Styling &amp; animations  JavaScript – Game logic
This Memory Card Game is one of my initial projects while exploring web development.
I built it to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and to get more comfortable with DOM manipulation and event handling.
The game is simple: flip the cards, try to match the pairs, and test how sharp your memory is.
Through this project, I learned how small concepts like loops, conditions, and styling can come together to build something interactive and fun.
It’s not just a game but also a reflection of my learning journey so far.
